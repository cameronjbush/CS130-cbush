## MATLAB HW #1
| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name: | Cameron Bush |
| Description: | Makes a 10x10 table of 
distances for different angles and launch
velocities. It will also make a plot of 
the minimum velocity required to reach 30 
meters and allows the user to input an angle and 
velocity to plot a projectile trajectory. |
